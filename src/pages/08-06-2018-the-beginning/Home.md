This space has been empty for quite a while

Until today

Today, I dive into the ideas, the creations,
my poorly derived notions, and my fascinations

I'm not much of an essayist, more of a scribbler

But, this is where I'll forge my thoughts
on design patterns, travel, concurrency in Java,
running, deep learning, music, AI bots, and art

Today? Well, today is just a start.
